<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Idris but many people call me Machala, i'm an easy going person that loves money and i don't have money yet but i'm pray God bless me abundantly.</p>

<p>I love to play CODM(call of duty mobile) because that's what relieves me of stress and at some point i almost got addicted
  but i'm grateful i was able to get over it.</p>

<p>Growing up was not easy and it never even been easy too but God keeps putting me through and i'm so grateful for that and the gift of life.</p>
